### Netsle ( Rust / React / Redux / Node.js )
Netsle is an open sourced project aimed to provide monitoring abilities of a network (enterprise/home based).
at it's core Netsle uses a layer in the Linux system called "eBPF"
it's essentially the first place in the system where packets go to, right after the network adapter.

then we can drop/pass/halt packets and monitor their behaviours and the different contents.
Netsle has a Dashboard which aims to provide very basic information about the network such as:
- Network usage (downstream)
- Packets amount respective to a selected time
- The most used ports in the network
- The most communicated-with hosts in the network

Netsle also has the ability to let the net-admin to block hosts from the network using a rather intuative UI
which lets you submit an IP to blacklist and update the router with the respective arguments.
